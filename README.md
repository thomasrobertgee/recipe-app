# Recipe App MVP

This project is a full-stack Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a recipe recommendation app. The goal is to help users save money by generating recipes based on supermarket specials, tailored to their personal preferences.

The application consists of a Python backend that serves data from a database and a React frontend that displays that data.

## Current Features

- **Full User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and maintain a persistent session using JWTs.
- **Robust Web Scraper:**
    - Utilizes **ScrapingBee** to bypass bot detection and render JavaScript-heavy pages.
    - Scrapes specific, high-value categories (e.g., "Meat & Seafood", "Fruit & Vegetables").
    - **Dynamically handles pagination**, scraping all available pages for each category automatically.
    - Extracts detailed price information, including unit prices (e.g., per kg).
- **AI-powered recipe generation** that uses a user's saved preferences and pantry items to create tailored recipes.
- **My Pantry Feature:** Users can add from a categorized list of staple ingredients to their personal pantry.
- **Recipe Ratings & Filtering:** Users can rate recipes and filter/sort them.
- **Intelligent Shopping List:** A dynamic list that consolidates ingredients, calculates costs, and tracks spending against a user's budget.
- Full CRUD functionality for recipes and specials.

## Getting Started

...(The rest of the README remains the same)...

To get the application running locally, you will need to set up and run both the backend and the frontend.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```sh
    cd recipe-app/backend
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows (Git Bash)
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd recipe-app/frontend
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Seeding the Database (Optional)

To populate your database with a large set of sample data, you can run the seeder script.
**Note:** This will delete all existing users, recipes, and specials.

1.  Make sure your backend server is running.
2.  In a second backend terminal (with the venv active), run:
    ```sh
    python seed.py
    ```
This will create 26 test users (`a@a.com` to `z@z.com`, password: `1234567890`) and 150 specials from Coles, Woolworths, and Aldi.

## Running the Full Application

For the app to work, both servers must be running simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    In your backend terminal (`recipe-app/backend`), run:
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    In your frontend terminal (`recipe-app/frontend`), run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## API Endpoints

- **`GET /api/recipes`**: Retrieves a list of all recipes in the database.
- **`GET /docs`**: View the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI).
